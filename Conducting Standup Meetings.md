# Conducting Standup Meetings

<NEED TO COMPLETE, BELOW IS COPY AND PASTED FROM THE TL HANDBOOK AS PLACEHOLDER>

Standup Meetings are important for several reasons:
1. It is an opportunity to practice communication skills, e.g. reporting to other humans on your team what you did today, what you need to finish, and sharing any blockers or breakthroughs. This helps not only the team, but also the individual sharing - the act of reflecting on your day by assessing your accomplishments, and putting those things into words is a big part of not only how we dialogue with our peers/associates/colleagues versed in the specialized language of software engineering. It also helps the individual to make connections and build their network of understanding; their ability to make accurate predictions about how long work will take; and it improves analytical thinking.
2. It is a time to practice your on-line professionalism, e.g. your appearance, your screen sharing kung-fu (demo'ing the behavior of your work, how you walk people through the code which resulted in that behavior), your patience and listening skills.
3. It is an opportunity to help other software engineers - the more eyes on a block/bug/problem, the more likely resolution can be obtained.

Because software engineering is not an individual effort, the #1 thing which software engineering employers are looking for is the applicants *soft skills.* Tech skills are of course very important, but if you cannot communicate effectively, if your are not able to work in a team, if you are unwilling to adapt and try new things, if you cannot manage your time, if you cannot achieve personal responsibility and accountability, then however awesome your software engineering adventure, your career will stall. Team meetings and standups are one way we impart these skills to students. Looking ahead, in Labs especially, the onus is upon teamwork. Standup meetings are required and essential to preparing students for not only Labs, not only getting a job, but for sustaining their *career.* The dialogue and relationships you form with your teammates will augment your background understanding, and help you build your confidence and identity as a computer scientist.

During daily standup, your entire team (including you!) should meet for a quick status update, answering the following three questions:
- What did I accomplish today?
- What do I still need to finish before tomorrow?
- What obstacles are in my way?

These status updates should be *short* - under a minute for each person. Your job is not to solve blockers immediately. Acknowledge them, tell the students youâ€™ll help come up with a solution. You should address the concerns after standup reports are finished.

Here are a few steps for addressing the concerns:
- Try to determine the root of the problem
- Identify a short-term solution to get students through tomorrow
- Plan a long-term solution that addresses the root of the problem
- Present the plans to the student
- Follow up regularly according to the plan

If there are no more bugs or blocks to address, each student should demo their applications behavior and code base. Team Leads should encourage students to articulate how their work meets the stated objectives for the Sprint module assignment.

Monday afternoons are reserved for careers lesson review. You can find a list of question prompts to guide your career conversation [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14nFo7xiG_SjoxHMhSHgz5vjjwuXjgUZRJTd3N9yIa1M/edit?usp=sharing), but the most important thing is to offer students an opportunity to reflect on the careers lesson from that sprint, ask questions, and share ideas with one another.
