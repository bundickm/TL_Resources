# Purpose
This repo is intended to help elevate the performance of team leads (new and veterans) by standardizing and simplifying a lot of the day to day activities. By taking care of the daily tasks by providing prompts, reminders, and resources the team leads time is freed up to more wholly focus on their students. Nothing in this repo is intended to replace the agency of the team leads, at any point they are free to ignore or modify any of the content to suit their style and the needs of the students.

# Format
In each unit folder you will find a folder for each sprint. Each of those sprint folders contains a markdown file for each day of the week plus any additional resources that may be necessary. The daily markdown files contain multiple items to copy and paste into the TL's channel - reminders, resources, etc. The markdown files also contain questions and discussion topics for 1-on-1's and Standups. The README in each sprint folder contains relevant resources for the week, some of these are included in the daily markdowns and some are additional resources to share or use as needed.
