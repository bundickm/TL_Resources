## 1-on-1 Discussion
Choose a chi-squared test from the assignment and then ask the students the following questions:
1. What is the null hypothesis for this particular test?
2. Does the p-value allow us to reject the null hypothesis?
3. Interpret the results of this chi-squared test as though you are explaining it to a non-technical person.
4. When do we use a t-test and when do we use a chi-squared test?

## Stand-up Discussion
1. Tomorrow is a light day, building a portfolio. Spend any extra time you have tomorrow studying for the sprint challenge.
2. Review [this notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1KtvdA8_oZj76dulTC3Fii7c6Latpw4Xb) with the students. Filtering, feature engineering, and top-N are all necessary for successfully completing the sprint challenge on Friday.
3. Ask what the difference is between frequentist and bayesian statistics
