## 1-on-1 Discussion
Ask the students the following questions:
1. What is the difference between frequentist and bayesian statistics?
2. What is a prior belief? What does it have to do with bayesian statistics?

## Stand-up Discussion
1. Today we built the skeleton of your portfolio sites. It is strongly encouraged that you maintain it and update it as you complete projects and articles. It is easier to maintain and slowly update then to rush when you need it.
2. Tomorrow is the sprint challenge, covering the first three days of this week. Complete the study guide and you should be in a good position to pass it.

I strongly encourage all of you to complete it so that you are fully prepared for the sprint challenge tomorrow.
