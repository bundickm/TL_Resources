## Stand-up Discussion
Encourage your students to take studying seriously this week. Statistics is a difficult week but they can get through it. There are plenty of additional resources for each of the topics this week.

Ask your students the following questions:
1. What is the normal distribution?
2. What is a null hypothesis?
3. What is the difference between a 1-sample and a 2-sample (`ttest_ind`) t-test?
4. What is a p-value? How does it relate to statistical signifigance?
