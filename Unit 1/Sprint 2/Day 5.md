You'll find the sprint challenge in the main channel. Remember to focus on getting answers down for each section, you can always come back to polish things up if you have time. Once you are done, send a link to your Colab notebook to me. You all are going to do great!

Thirty minutes left, still plenty of time, just focus on making sure you have an answer for each section.

## After Lunch
Post the following:
```
If you haven't already picked out a dataset for your build week project, please take some time over the weekend to start looking for one. You can use sites like Kaggle, Dataworld, and UCI to find a large number of datasets, just avoid the overdone ones like the UCI top ten or Kaggle's Titanic dataset. You can also try your hand at webscraping but if that is your plan you should start that immediately, you don't want to go into build week still trying to collect your data. 

Please be prepared to discuss 1 or 2 datasets you want to use for your build week project during our 1-on-1's on Wednesday.

## 1-on-1 Discussion
At the end of the sprint challenge are questions asking the student interpret their t-tests and chi-squared tests. Ask them to delve deeper into those tests - what is the null hypothesis? what does the p-value tell us? explain the results as though you are talking to a non-technical person.
