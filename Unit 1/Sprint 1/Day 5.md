You'll find the first sprint challenge in the main channel. Remember to focus on getting answers down for each section, you can always come back to polish things up if you have time. Once you are done, send a link to your Colab notebook to me. You all are going to do great!

Thirty minutes left, still plenty of time, just focus on making sure you have an answer for each section.

Your first sprint challenge is officially over! If you haven't done so already, please DM me a link to your sprint challenge. Go get yourself some lunch and relax, this afternoon I'll be doing 1-on-1's to review your SC's so make sure to come back.

## 1-on-1 Discussion
Review the students sprint challenge with them just like you would an assignment. The biggest difference is you will need to point out what they could have done or did do to get a three.

Ask the students the following questions:
1. Why is it important to validate that there are no nulls in the provided dataset?
2. How did your EDA in section two help you answer the questions in section three?
3. Is there any other interesting information you discovered through your EDA?
