# Day 4

## Warm-up
Post the following in your channel:
```
Please participate in the warmup posted in the main channel. Should you get done early and haven't already done so, read the training kit found here: https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recK7pBbrxfDphtSd/

Or get a jump on learning matplotlib with this tutorial notebook: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Za-IVwxIU8kqn8pmgI2szFB894cONJJI
```

## 1-on-1 Discussion
Ask the students the following questions:
1. What is data wrangling?
2. What is the tidy data format? Why is it useful to transform our data in this way?
3. Find a join in their assignment. Ask them to explain what type of join it is and what data is included from each dataframe.
4. How do plan on preparing for the sprint challenge tomorrow?

## Stand-up Discussion
1. Tomorrow the students will have their first SC. Once again, encourage them to complete the study guide to prepare.
2. Open up discussion for questions about the sprint challenge. Try to avoid telling students exactly what is on the SC as this leads to them studying to the test and ignoring important code and concepts that don't show up.

## End of Day
Post the following:
```
If you haven't seen it yet, check out the study guide here: https://github.com/bundickm/Study-Guides/blob/master/Unit_1_Sprint_1_Data_Wrangling_and_Visualizations_Study_Guide.ipynb

I strongly encourage all of you to complete it so that you are fully prepared for the sprint challenge tomorrow.

And here is a tutorial notebook on matplotlib just in case you aren't feeling great on it yet: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Za-IVwxIU8kqn8pmgI2szFB894cONJJI
