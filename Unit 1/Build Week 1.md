# Build Week 1
## Monday
### Morning Standup
1. Review the schedule posted on Friday
2. Review the specific expectations for today: "By end of day you should have completed cleaning and exploring your dataset, and have a clear idea of the story you are going to tell."
3. No 1-on-1's today, but there will be for the rest of the week, just like normal.
4. TL's are available all day if you get stuck, have questions, or need advice
5. Any questions?

### Afternoon Standup
In addition to the normal talking about the struggles and successes of the day, students should also talk about their datasets and where they are at in the process. Did they get through cleaning and EDA? What story do they want to tell about the data?

### Notebook Expectations
Post and pin the following in the morning:
```
Notebook Expectations
------------------------
Notebook Must Haves
-Clean and organized - easy to follow thought process, visuals are at relevant positions in notebook, not dumped at the end, etc. A reader shouldn't have to scroll up and down a bunch to figure out what you are doing
-Runs from top to bottom
-Contains data cleaning, exploration, and visualizations (basic exploration)
-Contains at least 2 polished visuals that could be used in the blog post

Notebook Really Should Haves
-Markdown headers used to clearly dileneate the sections of the notebook
-Markdown intro paragraph - what is the dataset, what do you plan on showing the reader
-Markdown closing/summary paragraph - Now that the data is explored, what are the cliff notes takeaways
-Variables and functions are descriptively named
-Code is commented

Notebook is Polished
-Markdown is used throughout to explain your thought process and reasoning, explains tradeoffs, uses outside knowledge if necessary to support decisions, etc.
-Code is DRY and is highly readable with use of whitespace, naming, etc. - See PEP8. Good code is often "self commenting" so comments should be present only when needed and concise.
-Markdown conclusion paragraph is expanded and goes into more detail.
-Ideally the notebook should be a thorough and technical presentation of your work that can be read and fully understood without you needing to provide further context or clarification.

Ancillary Details
-Notebook is uploaded to github
-Notebook and blog post are linked to from your portfolio site
-Github repo is free of rough drafts (I shouldn't see "My_Project_v1", "My_Project_v2", etc.)
-Notebook and github repo names do not include "Lambda" or "Project", this is a portfolio piece not a homework assignment. Markdown/comments in the notebook should also be free of indications this is a class assignment.

You are expected to complete the "Must Haves" and the Ancillary Details for your notebook to get a 2 but strive to at least hit some of the "Really Should Haves"

Example Notebook: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1dxG4r9M1Q9IdBcCl0sdQKeIUMvzjT5m6
```

### 1-on-1 Discussion
1. If the student is behind (still doing cleaning and EDA), what is their plan to catch up?
2. What story does the student want to tell with their project? How does the data support this?
3. What are their plans for the rest of the week?
4. Have they read the notebook expectations earlier? Do they have any questions?

### Presentation Tips
Post and pin this 30 minutes before standup:
```
How to give a good presentation:
---------------------------------
DO
1. Practice practice practice, 2 minutes goes fast
2. Start strong with a hook, give the audience a reason to care. This can be personal, an interesting rabit hole the data took you down, a strugle with the data, etc.
3. Tell a story, they make your presentation easy to follow and people are keyed to respond to them. Stories have a beginning, middle, and end.
4. Have a simple core message and ask yourself if what you are saying is necessary to support that message, you don't have time to tell us you loaded the data and did EDA, get to the point
5. Sell it through your energy, if you sound or look bored then your audience is going to be
6. If you are sharing your screen then be prepared, don't waste time navigating to what you want to show - start with the image up. If you are using 2 images, have a quick way to flip to the next one.

DON'T
1. Give a play-by-play of your last week, your notebook, or blog (give us a reason to seek out those things)
2. Point out the flaws in your work, don't make it easy for the audience to discount what you are saying (This is different from a presentation about failure, perseverance, and eventual success or lessons learned)
3. Distract the audience, if you are sharing your screen close/hide tabs and toolbars that aren't needed, silence slack, etc.
4. Read/memorize a script because it usually sounds robotic, instead have bullet points of what you want to say so you hit the main points while maintaining a conversational style.
5. Bog us down with text or unnecessary details, if someone is reading a paragraph of text during your presentation then you have lost their attention, keep it simple and to 1 or 2 visuals (pretty pictures)
```

### Standup Discussion
1. Did everyone get their first polished visual complete?
2. Discuss notebook expectations, review the post pinned this morning. Look over the example notebook to give the students an idea of the level of polish and quality they can achieve.
3. Discuss how to give a good presentation, review the post pinned right before standup. Remind the students they will be practicing presentations tomorrow during standup.

## Wednesday
Post the following at 8 AM to aid with taking daily attendance:
```
Attendance Thread: Please add an emoji to this thread so I know you didn't oversleep.
```

### 1-on-1 Discussion
1. Compare their notebook to the expectations laid out yesterday. How can they better organize the notebook?
2. Ask them to point out sections of code they think could be refactored
3. Give feedback on both of their polished visuals they plan on using for the blog post
4. Do they have a rough draft of their blog post?

### Standup Discussion
Skip the usual talking about each person's day to save time. Give a brief overview of the presentation practice:
- Giving 2 minute presentations, hard cut off at 2 minutes. Today is all about the rough edges and getting students used to how short 2 minutes is.
- At the end of 2 minutes, you will give feedback. What did they do well, where could they have improved?
- Once the feedback is given, the person that just presented should call on the next person.
- Remind them of the presentation tips posted yesterday.

After the presentation, summarize some of the positive and negative things you saw. Remind the students that they will be giving practice presentations during standup tomorrow as well. Finally, let them know that the plan for tomorrow should be about polishing and wrapping up their projects. There shouldn't be any brand new code tomorrow, just refactoring. If they don't feel like that is currently possible based on where they are at, they should spend additional time tonight to catch up.

## Thursday
Post the following at 8 AM to aid with taking daily attendance:
```
Attendance Thread: You know the drill by now, add an emoji.

Also, a quick reminder, you should be wrapping up your projects today. Complete your blog post and polish your notebook. Before you hit publish on your blog post I encourage you to share it in our channel and the cohort channel to get feedback.

```
### Deliverables
Post and pin this after lunch:

```
Minimum To-Do/Turn In By EOD
------------------------------
-Notebook with data cleaning, exploration, and visualizations. Must run from top to bottom
-Blog post communicating insights/story based on the dataset in the notebook. Must have 2 polished visualizations in the blog post.
-Notebook and relevant supporting docs (i.e. - csv's, scraping code, etc.) uploaded to a github repo
-Portfolio site links to blog post and notebook/repo

Rubric and Further Details Here: https://github.com/LambdaSchool/DS-Unit-1-Build
```

### 1-on-1 Discussion
1. Help the student triage their work, what do they need to get done in order to complete the build week?
2. Where are they at with their blog post?
3. Remind them to review the deliverables post that was dropped today. Also, review the notebook expectations pinned post.

### Standup Discussion
Skip the usual talking about each person's day to save time. Give a brief overview of the presentation practice:
- Giving 2 minute presentations, 30s warning at the 2 minute mark, hard cut off at 2:30
- At the end of 2 minutes, students will give feedback. What did they do well, where could they have improved? Remind them to balance good and bad feedback, don't let them dump on their peers.
- Once students have given feedback, you will add any feedback you feel was missed.
- Once the feedback is given, the person that just presented should call on the next person.
- Remind them of the presentation tips posted yesterday.

After the presentations, remind them of the deliverables due before they go to bed. If they are behind, they should focus on hitting the minimum requirements. If they are in a healthy spot, they should aim to polish up their work to aim for a 3 and be comparable to the example notebook.

## Friday
- Communicate the schedule for the day, and what time they have remaining should the students still need to work on their projects.
- Encourage students to attend the presentations for labs and other cohorts as time allows.
- Give words of encouragement in your TL channel at the start of the presentation time.
- DM each of your students after their presentations to congratulate them.
- 1-on-1's should be fairly quick if the students have been keeping pace with the schedule set at the start of the week. If they passed, ask them to reflect back on how far they have come in the first month of Lambda.

Remove the pinned build week posts and pin & post the following:
