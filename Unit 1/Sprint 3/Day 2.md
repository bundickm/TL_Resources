## 1-on-1 Discussion
Ask the students the following questions:
1. Question 1.5 asks if there is a relationship between vectors. If the student has not done so already, ask them to explain that relationship.
2. Question 2.1 prompts the students to find all the legal combinations. If they haven't done so already, point out that this can be done programatically and ask how they would approach the problem.
3. Question 3.4 asks if two matrices are equal. If the student hasn't done so already, ask for them to explain why they are equivalent without simply saying the numbers match. Force them to use some of the terms learned in the lesson.

## Stand-up Discussion
- Tomorrow we will be reviewing your datasets for your build week project during the 1-on-1's. Please make sure you have a dataset picked out by tomorrow.

Ask the students the following questions:
1. What is the difference between variance, standard deviation, covariance, and correlation?
2. What is orthogonality? What is an orthogonal basis?
3. What is the rank of a matrix? How do we find the rank of a matrix?
4. What is projection?
