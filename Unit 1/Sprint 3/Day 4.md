## 1-on-1 Discussion
Ask the students the following questions:
1. What is a dimensionality reduction technique that is not PCA?
2. Review sections 6.1 and 6.2
3. Can we say a principle component feature derived through PCA is the same as one of the features used in the PCA process?

## Stand-up Discussion
- Tomorrow is the sprint challenge. Complete the study guide and you should be in a good position to pass it. 

Ask the students the following questions
1. What is the difference between supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning? Which one is clustering?
2.  Explain k-means clustering as though you are talking to a non-technical person.
3. How is an elbow plot used with k-means clustering? What does it help us determine?
