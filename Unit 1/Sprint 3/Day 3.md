## 1-on-1 Discussion
Ask the students the following questions:
1. What is the difference between variance and covariance?
2. How are covariance and correlation related?
3. What is Gaussian elimination? What does it have to do with Rank?
4. Explain linear projection as though you are talking to a non-technical person


Review student datasets to ensure they are useable. Focus on size (not too small or too big), possible research questions, and student ability to clean and manipulate the data.

## Stand-up Discussion
Ask the students the following questions:
1. What is PCA? What are the uses for it?
2. What is the “Curse of Dimensionality”?
3. What is an eigenvector?

PCA tends to be a difficult day for quite a few students, let the students know this is normal and that if they are feeling a bit unsure there are resources to help them out.
