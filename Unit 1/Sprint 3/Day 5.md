------------------

Monday: Standup in the morning to set expectations and answer questions. By end of day you should have completed cleaning and exploring your dataset, and have a clear idea of the story you are going to tell. End of day standup will be talking about your datasets and where you are at in the process.

Tuesday: Explore visualizations to help tell the story of your data. Create a rough outline for your blogpost. Pick a visualization and polish it to the point of being ready to drop in a blog post. 1-on-1's will be general feedback on your notebook so far. Standup will be talking about notebook and presentation expectations.

Wednesday: Complete a second polished visualization. Rough draft of your blog post completed. Rough code lockdown by end of day (need for polish expected but there shouldn't be much in the way of new code, feature engineering, graphs, etc.). 1-on-1's will be feedback on notebook with a focus on structure and polish. Standup will be practicing giving 2 minute presentations, hard cut off at 2 minutes, and feedback by myself.

Thursday: Polish the notebook and blog post. 1-on-1's will be focused on getting you to a high quality completed project. Standup will be practicing giving a 2 minute presentation with friendly critique from myself and your peers. If you get a blog post to a finished state, I encourage you to share for feedback before hitting that publish button. Project should be submitted to me by end of night.

Friday: Presentations to the whole class. Push your project to github and portfolio site if not already done.
