```

## Warm-up
Warm-up on the first day will be introductions, first will be a short meeting welcoming the students, and introducing the team leads and instructor. After that will be an introduction with your team lead group. Introduce yourself and then ask the students to answer these questions:
1. Why are you at Lambda School?
2. What did you do before Lambda School?
3. Icebreaker question: "Tell us something unique about yourself"
4. Do you have prior programming experience? If so, how much and what languages?

After the introductions, as time permits cover the following:
- If you are missing replies to the github name/os/timezone thread, remind them to reply to it.
- Point out the pinned resources and that they have daily and weekly forms to fill out that they can find there.
- Channels to join, ideally list these in your team channel: cohort specific ones, DS track channels (ds_help, ds_general, etc.), city specific channels for meetups and local info, and any others you may find useful.

Should you not have time to cover the additional topics during warm-up, you can either drop the information in your channel in the afternoon or you can bring it up during standup.

## Stand-up
Since it is the first stand-up you will need to introduce the format for stand-ups and set expectations.
- Stand-up and 1-on-1's are required. If a student can't make a stand-up or 1-on-1 they should inform you as soon as they know. If a student is not in stand-up, ping them with `@<STUDENT NAME>` before starting stand-up.
- Stand-ups will be at the same time every day unless otherwise noted by the TL
- Stand-up will begin with each student talking about how their day went - What did they complete, what do they still need to do, struggles or breakthroughs. Once a student is done talking, they call on the next person until all students have gone. As TL you may interrupt to answer questions, add clarification, encouragement, etc.
- Once all students have talked about their day the TL will discuss topics to reinforce the days content or information that will prepare the students for upcoming parts of the course.

### Stand-up Discussion - Day 1
Always open the floor for questions after every topic
1. Any topics from warm-up that weren't covered
2. Has everyone forked the github repo for the week? Repo is pinned, github forking steps are in the training kit (also pinned)
3. Ask students what each of the following functions do:
```
df.shape
df.head()
df.dtypes
df.describe()
df[‘column’].value_counts()
df.isnull().sum()
df.fillna()
df.dropna()
df.drop()
pd.crosstab()
```
4. Offer encouragement, the first few weeks feel overwhelming but they can get through it and thrive. You are here to support them at every step. If they need help beyond 1-on-1's and stand-up they simply need to ask any TL or SL. Later in the week you will discuss the Sprint Challenge - what to expect and how to prepare. For now, the best thing to prepare is to do the assignments. Finally, they can breathe a sigh of relief, Day 1 is done!
