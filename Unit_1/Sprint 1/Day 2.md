## 1-on-1's
Edit and then post the following in your channel after lunch:
```
@channel Today will be the first day of 1-on-1's so I wanted to let you know what to expect.
- 1-on-1's are required but just like stand-ups, they serve a purpose. Code reviews are an industry standard - this will help you get use to them in a safe learning environment while also helping us address issues before they become big problems.
- 1-on-1's take 10-15 minutes, sometimes longer if you need help with something.
- <WRITE HOW YOU DETERMINE WHEN EACH PERSON WILL HAVE THEIR 1-ON-1. SCHEDULED? RANDOM? BETWEEN A SET TIME?>
- During the 1-on-1 we will be going over the previous day's assignment. This will include checking for completion, discussing personal struggles with the assignment, commenting, and DRY readable code.
- I may ask you questions to probe your understanding of the code and concepts
- 1-on-1's are also your time to ask questions. Please don't hesitate to bring up topics you want to discuss or questions you have even if they aren't related to the assignment.
```

### 1-on-1 Discussion
See the 1-on-1 advice here if you would like a clearer idea of what to look for in a 1-on-1. It's never too early to critique for PEP8 compliant code or DRY code, just couch the feedback in preventing bad habits they would have to break later to pass Unit 3.

Ask the student the following questions:
1. How do I find out if there are nulls in a dataset?
2. Why is it important to check the head of a dataframe?
3. Find a crosstab in their work or the lecture notebook and ask them to explain how to read it.
4. Find a graph in their work and ask them to explain it. What does the graph tell us? Is this the best way to represent this data? If it is missing title and axis labels, encourage them to get into the good habit of always including those at minimum.

End on a positive note and/or word of encouragement.

## Stand-up Discussion
- Encourage students to start preparing for the sprint challenge by creating a notebook with all of the various functions they have seen so far and examples for each. See the following cheat sheets: [Pandas](https://github.com/bundickm/CheatSheets/blob/master/Data_Cleaning_and_Exploring_Cheat_Sheet.ipynb), [Matplotlib](https://github.com/bundickm/CheatSheets/blob/master/MatplotLib_Cheat_Sheet.ipynb)
- Discuss stretch goals in assignments and sprint challenges are there to push you. If time allows they should be attempted to drive the students' personal growth.
- The sprint challenge will be discussed Wednesday and Thursday during stand-up so bring questions tomorrow.

Ask the students the following:
1. Can someone define feature engineering? Why is it important? Examples of engineered features?
2. What is NaN? What are some ways to handle null values? Why is it important to remove null values?
3. What is a function? How do we write one? Why are they useful?
4. How do we change a column to datetime format?
