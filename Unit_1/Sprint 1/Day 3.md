# Day 3

## Warm-up
Post the following in your channel:
```
Please participate in the warmup posted in the main channel. Should you get done early and haven't already done so, read the training kit found here: https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recLMyOUPqsW4wm90/

This cheat sheet may be useful for today's lecture and assignment as well: https://github.com/bundickm/CheatSheets/blob/master/Data_wrangling_cheatsheet.pdf

## 1-on-1 Discussion
The day 2 lecture introduces functions and the `.apply` method, both extremely useful for writing DRY code. After reviewing the assignment, use the bulk of your time with each student to make sure they are comfortable writing functions.

Ask the students the following questions:
1. What is feature engineering? Why is it important?
2. How does EDA impact our feature engineering?
3. How do we create a new column in our dataframe?
4. How do we write a function? How is `.apply` used with functions? What makes for a good function? See the function section in the [1-on-1 doc]() for cliff notes on a good function. If the student has issues with writing functions, [this notebook](https://github.com/bundickm/Warmup_Notebooks/blob/master/Warmup_Functions.ipynb) may be useful to them.

## Stand-up Discussion
Ask the student the following questions:
1. What are the types of joins?
2. What data is included from each dataframe when we do an inner join?
3. What is tidy data?  Why is it useful to transform our data in this way?
4. What are some functions we can use to transform a dataframe into the tidy format?
5. How do we select a subset of a dataframe?

You can discuss the following during standup and then post it in your channel:
```
What to expect in the sprint challenge:
- Sprint Challenge is 3 hours long, from 8 AM to 11 AM
- At 8 AM the Section Lead or Instructor will post the SC in the main channel. It will be a `.ipynb` file that you will need to download and then upload to Colab. If you aren't sure how to do this, practice it before the SC so you don't waste time when it counts.
- Read the instructions fully before doing each section
- Focus on getting passable answers for each section before worrying about polish or attempting a 3, you can always come back. It does you no good if you spend time perfecting one section only to fail the sprint challenge because you ran out of time for the rest.
- TL's can't help you with the SC but if you get stuck with something like setup, reach out.
- Once you have finished the SC, send me a share link of your colab notebook.
- After I have your SC I'll look it over and grade it. We will then meet for a 1-on-1 to discuss your submission.
- On Friday's, once you have had your 1-on-1 you are usually free for the day. There will be an optional sprint review with the instructor but that is your choice on whether to attend or not.
- Should you receive a 1 on the SC, you will need to attempt a retake. During our 1-on-1 we will discuss the details of a retake if they are necessary.
- Tomorrow a study guide will be posted, if you spend time working through it you should be prepared for the SC.
- What's on the sprint challenge? The core topics from each day. Do the assignments and the study guide and you should have no worries.
