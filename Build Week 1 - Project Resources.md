# Build Week 1

## Prep for Build Week
**Wednesday of Sprint 2** talk to the students about build week, what to expect, and getting a dataset. Set the expectation of getting a dataset no later than Wednesday of Sprint 3 so that you can review it and ensure it is a useable dataset. Copy and paste the following:

```
Here are resources for the first build week. Take a look to get an idea of what is expected and what types of projects/datasets you can do. Remember, pick out a dataset by Wednesday of next week.

DS10 Presentations - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZmvcGN9yqY&feature=youtu.be
```

**Friday of Sprint 2**, immediately after lunch copy and paste the following.
```
If you haven't already picked out a dataset for your build week project, please take some time over the weekend to start looking for one. You can use sites like Kaggle, Dataworld, and UCI to find a large number of datasets, just avoid the overdone ones like the UCI top ten or Kaggle's Titanic dataset. You can also try your hand at webscraping but if that is your plan you should start that immediately, you don't want to go into build week still trying to collect your data. 

Please be prepared to discuss 1 or 2 datasets you want to use for your build week project during our 1-on-1's on Wednesday.

```

**Wednesday of Sprint 3**, review student datasets to ensure they are useable. Focus on size (not too small or too big), possible research questions, and student ability to clean and manipulate the data.

**Friday of Sprint 3**, remind students during the Sprint Challenge review that they need to have a dataset ready to use on Monday and that if possible they should spend time over the weekend to load, clean, and explore the dataset to set them up for success going into build week. Copy and Paste the 'Build Week Schedule and Expectations' below.

------------------

Monday: Standup in the morning to set expectations and answer questions. By end of day you should have completed cleaning and exploring your dataset, and have a clear idea of the story you are going to tell. End of day standup will be talking about your datasets and where you are at in the process.

Tuesday: Explore visualizations to help tell the story of your data. Create a rough outline for your blogpost. Pick a visualization and polish it to the point of being ready to drop in a blog post. 1-on-1's will be general feedback on your notebook so far. Standup will be talking about notebook and presentation expectations.

Wednesday: Complete a second polished visualization. Rough draft of your blog post completed. Rough code lockdown by end of day (need for polish expected but there shouldn't be much in the way of new code, feature engineering, graphs, etc.). 1-on-1's will be feedback on notebook with a focus on structure and polish. Standup will be practicing giving 2 minute presentations, hard cut off at 2 minutes, and feedback by myself.

Thursday: Polish the notebook and blog post. 1-on-1's will be focused on getting you to a high quality completed project. Standup will be practicing giving a 2 minute presentation with friendly critique from myself and your peers. If you get a blog post to a finished state, I encourage you to share for feedback before hitting that publish button. Project should be submitted to me by end of night.

Friday: Presentations to the whole class. Push your project to github and portfolio site if not already done.

Notebook Expectations
------------------------
Notebook Must Haves
-Clean and organized - easy to follow thought process, visuals are at relevant positions in notebook, not dumped at the end, etc. A reader shouldn't have to scroll up and down a bunch to figure out what you are doing
-Runs from top to bottom
-Contains data cleaning, exploration, and visualizations (basic exploration)
-Contains at least 2 polished visuals that could be used in the blog post

Notebook Really Should Haves
-Markdown headers used to clearly dileneate the sections of the notebook
-Markdown intro paragraph - what is the dataset, what do you plan on showing the reader
-Markdown closing/summary paragraph - Now that the data is explored, what are the cliff notes takeaways
-Variables and functions are descriptively named
-Code is commented

Notebook is Polished
-Markdown is used throughout to explain your thought process and reasoning, explains tradeoffs, uses outside knowledge if necessary to support decisions, etc.
-Code is DRY and is highly readable with use of whitespace, naming, etc. - See PEP8. Good code is often "self commenting" so comments should be present only when needed and concise.
-Markdown conclusion paragraph is expanded and goes into more detail.
-Ideally the notebook should be a thorough and technical presentation of your work that can be read and fully understood without you needing to provide further context or clarification.

Ancillary Details
-Notebook is uploaded to github
-Notebook and blog post are linked to from your portfolio site
-Github repo is free of rough drafts (I shouldn't see "My_Project_v1", "My_Project_v2", etc.)
-Notebook and github repo names do not include "Lambda", this is a portfolio piece not a homework assignment. Markdown/comments in the notebook should also be free of indications this is a class assignment.

You are expected to complete the "Must Haves" and the Ancillary Details for your notebook to get a 2 but strive to at least hit some of the "Really Should Haves"

How to give a good presentation:
---------------------------------
DO
1. Practice practice practice, 2 minutes goes fast
2. Start strong with a hook, give the audience a reason to care. This can be personal, an interesting rabit hole the data took you down, a strugle with the data, etc.
3. Tell a story, they make your presentation easy to follow and people are keyed to respond to them. Stories have a beginning, middle, and end.
4. Have a simple core message and ask yourself if what you are saying is necessary to support that message, you don't have time to tell us you loaded the data and did EDA, get to the point
5. Sell it through your energy, if you sound or look bored then your audience is going to be
6. If you are sharing your screen then be prepared, don't waste time navigating to what you want to show - start with the image up. If you are using 2 images, have a quick way to flip to the next one.

DON'T
1. Give a play-by-play of your last week, your notebook, or blog (give us a reason to seek out those things)
2. Point out the flaws in your work, don't make it easy for the audience to discount what you are saying (This is different from a presentation about failure, perseverance, and eventual success or lessons learned)
3. Distract the audience, if you are sharing your screen close/hide tabs and toolbars that aren't needed, silence slack, etc.
4. Read/memorize a script because it usually sounds robotic, instead have bullet points of what you want to say so you hit the main points while maintaining a conversational style.
5. Bog us down with text or unnecessary details, if someone is reading a paragraph of text during your presentation then you have lost their attention, keep it simple and to 1 or 2 visuals (pretty pictures)
```

```
Minimum To-Do/Turn In By EOD
------------------------------
-Notebook with data cleaning, exploration, and visualizations. Must run from top to bottom
-Blog post communicating insights/story based on the dataset in the notebook. Must have 2 polished visualizations in the blog post.
-Notebook and relevant supporting docs (i.e. - csv's, scraping code, etc.) uploaded to a github repo
-Portfolio site links to blog post and notebook/repo

## Final Day of Build Week
- Communicate the schedule for the day, and what time they have remaining should the students still need to work on their projects.
- Encourage students to attend the presentations for labs and other cohorts as time allows.
- Give words of encouragement in your TL channel at the start of the presentation time.
- DM each of your students after their presentations to congratulate them.
